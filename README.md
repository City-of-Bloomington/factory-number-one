This is the (eventual) successor to Factory Number One, an open-source design system for City of Bloomington websites & applications. It's heavily influenced by the the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov) 

This repository will house both the components and documentation (for now.) 

## About the name

Factory Number One is named after the Showers Brothers Furniture Company Factory Number 1. In the 1920s, the facility was arguably the largest furniture factory in the world, leveraging convenient access to the railroads to ship its dressers to retailers in large quantities. After World War II, the industry saw a shift from shipping by train, to shipping by truck, but the company didn't adapt to these changes in the market. The company closed its doors in 1958. Most of the facility was lost to a fire in 1969. One of the few buildings to survive was Factory Number 1. As of 2016, the building houses Bloomington, Indiana's City Hall, Monroe County offices, and office space for private companies.
