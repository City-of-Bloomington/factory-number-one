# Factory Number One (Centennial)

[![CircleCI Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/18F/web-design-standards/tree/develop.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/18F/web-design-standards/tree/develop) [![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/18F/web-design-standards/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/18F/web-design-standards/coverage)

This is the (eventual) successor to Factory Number One, an open-source design system for City of Bloomington websites & applications. It's heavily influenced by the the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov) 

This repository will house both the core components and documentation (for now.) 



## Using the Standards

There are a few different ways to use the Standards within your project. You'll want to refer to the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/blob/develop/README.md_) repo for specific details.



## About the name

2018 marks 150 years of existence for Monroe County & the City of Bloomington. Sesqicentennial seemed a bit long to say, so instead, we went with "Centennial" to differentiate this successor branch of Factory Number One.

Factory Number One is named after the Showers Brothers Furniture Company Factory Number 1. In the 1920s, the facility was arguably the largest furniture factory in the world, leveraging convenient access to the railroads to ship its dressers to retailers in large quantities. After World War II, the industry saw a shift from shipping by train, to shipping by truck, but the company didn't adapt to these changes in the market. The company closed its doors in 1958. Most of the facility was lost to a fire in 1969. One of the few buildings to survive was Factory Number 1. As of 2016, the building houses Bloomington, Indiana's City Hall, Monroe County offices, and office space for private companies.
