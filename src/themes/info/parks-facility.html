And while we're working hard to implement these initiatives, it is you, our citizens, who make Bloomington a terrific place to live. Our 100 police officers, 99 firefighters, free recycling services and more than 1,000 recreational opportunities are all a result of you expressing your community priorities.</p>

Government belongs to the people, and that means all the data and information, good and bad, flattering and un-, as well.</p>
